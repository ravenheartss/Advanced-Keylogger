## Features

- Captures the clipboard
- Sends an email every 10 minutes. (This will be reduced when adding more features)
	- Needs SMTP enabled in gmx or gmail. I didn't want to do using gmail so I made a temporary gmx account.

## TODO

- Screenshot every X minutes
- Self-destruction option
- Encrypt log and system files using PKC (Public Key Cryptography)
